## Wanting to create a website

Have you ever wanted to create your own website?

Don't want to rely on Wordpress and Squarespace but don't want to completely build it from scratch?

Me too! So, I've decided to create a website using Hugo.

## Why I'm using Hugo

What is Hugo? [According to Hugo's own website](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/), Hugo is a "static site generator". 

In other words, Hugo is a software application that lets you generate a HTML website from a set of template files. 

For those of you like me, who understand HTML and CSS code, this is great news because with a few tweaks and updates of the template files - whalla - you have a website.

## What is my website about?

As a technical writer by trade, I am passionate about three things - learning, sharing and delivering easy-to-understand content. 

To be a good technical writer, I know you don't have to be able to create websites. But it is a handy skill to learn, and as I develop my craft, I will share the lessons I've learnt along the way.
