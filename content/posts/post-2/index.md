## What is technical writing?

Technical writing is the art of translating complex topics in simple terms, usually in a written format. Technical writers create all sorts of material such as:
- User manuals
- Quick start guides
- Reports
- Presentations
- Papers

Technical writers work in many different sectors from mining and manufacturing, to IT and the public sector. 

## What sparked my interest in technical writing

Even in my uni days, I was always interested in explaining technology and technical concepts at a high level. Whether that be through writing experimental reports or creating standard operating procedures, I love the creative process of planning, executing and publishing to a wider audience.

I worked in a few different sectors doing different things, but my interest in writing never really left me, until I was offered a formal technical writing role in the private sector. 

## Working as a technical writer

Being a technical writer isn't just about writing. Here are a number of aspects you should account for when considering a career in technical writing:

- **You get to work with people with differing professional backgrounds**

    I've worked with software engineers and computer scientists to mining engineers, business analysts, business architects and graphic designers. It's a great way to get an understanding of the domain your working in, and leverage technical expertise. 
- **You get to test software** 

    This point only applies ofcourse, if you're writing software/IT manuals. But if you want to make sure that your instructions are accurate, then you need to become a superuser in that application. 
- **You might get to play with code** 

    As a software technical writer, I've had the opportunity to run Python scripts, write a bit of JavaScript and tweak HTML and CSS files. It's something that I really enjoy and hope to do more of in the future. 

## And the final word is...

Technical writing is a critical skill in a digital age. We need people that explain things clearly without jargon especially when talking about highly complex technologies.

If you enjoy writing and like to deep dive into highly technical topics, then technical writing may be the career for you.
