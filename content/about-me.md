I am a technical writer from Adelaide with a combined interest of writing and technology. 

Here is a list of projects I have worked on as a technical writer:

- [Restructuring the Maptek Evolution documentation](https://help.maptek.com/evolution/2022.1/Default.htm).
- [Creating a Quick Start Guide for Maptek DomainMCF](https://help-files.maptek.com/maptek-domainmcf/2021.3/DomainMCF%20Quickstart%20Guide.pdf).
- Profile writing for the Australian Public Service Commission (not yet published). 
- Contributing to the successful [2022 Google Season of Docs OpenMS project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZdvBJ2XPw5C4Kth2sr53EFHZhW_-_YTLEgqXYRg03I/edit).
